While developing [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), we came to learn about the several challenges imposed by having to run a distributed file system on top of heterogeneous devices, with diferent network setups and capabilities. During this process, we had to constantly revisit the whole network stack and create solutions to overcome the obstacles imposed by design decisions of the several layers and protocols, without breaking compatibility or recreating technologies. This was a tedious, time consuming process.


Instead of re-inventing the wheel every time we need to build a decentralized P2P application, we focused on streamlining the problem by tackling networking complexity in an abstract, general purpose way. The result is **libp2p**: a framework for simplifying networking with P2P applications. Developers decide on how they want their app to interop with others in the network, favoring configuration and extensibility instead of assumptions about networking setup. The goal is to enable rapid development of P2P applications for everyone.

**We are still actively developing libp2p, so expect the specification to change.**

## Goals and Requirements

Our goals for libp2p specification and its implementations are:

- Enable the use of various transports (TCP, UDP, DTLS, uTP, etc)
- Efficient use of sockets (connection reuse)
- Enable communications between peers to be multiplex over one socket (avoiding handshake overhead)
- Enable multiprotocols and respective versions to be used between peers, using a negotiation process.
- Be backwards compatible
- Work in current systems
- Use the current network technologies to its best capability
- Have NAT Traversal
- Enable connections to be relayed
- Enable encrypted channels

## Implementations <small>(note: work in progress!)</small>

## You can make libp2p better!

Libp2p is a work in progress. As such, there's a few things you can do right now to help out:

- **Read the spec!** If you have any questions or comments, issues or changes, weigh in on [libp2p/specs](https://github.com/libp2p/specs).
- Go through the modules above and **check out existing issues**. This would be especially useful for modules in active development. Some knowledge of IPFS/libp2p may be required, as well as the infrasture behind it - for instance, you may need to read up on p2p and more complex operations like muxing to be able to help technically.
- **Perform code reviews**. Most of this has been developed by @diasdavid, which means that more eyes will help a) speed the project along b) ensure quality and c) reduce possible future bugs.
- **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests.
- **Talk to us.** You can find us on IRC at #ipfs on Freenode.
